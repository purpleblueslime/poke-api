            At Poke, we believe the camera isn't just for capturing ‚Äî it's for

          <div>Q 1. What's a poke?</div>
          <div className='ans'>
            A poke is a tiny moment you send to someone ‚Äî a photo or video,
            unfiltered and fast. Not a story. Not a post. Just a direct moment.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div className='qna'>
          <div>Q 2. Why would I send one?</div>
          <div className='ans'>
            Because sometimes, you don't want to text. You want to show. A
            smile, a sky, a coffee cup, a memory, a mood. A poke is a way of
            saying, ‚ÄúThis made me think of you.‚Äù
          </div>
        </div>
        <div className='qna'>
          <div>Q 3. Is it just like Snapchat?</div>
          <div className='ans'>
            It's not about streaks or filters. Poke is simpler. Cleaner. It's
            about sharing your now ‚Äî not curating it.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div className='qna'>
          <div>Q 4. Who sees my poke?</div>
          <div className='ans'>
            Only the people you choose. One tap, one send, straight to their
            chat.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div className='qna'>
          <div>Q 5. What's the point?</div>
          <div className='ans'>
            Poke isn't here to distract you. It's here to connect you. Quietly.
            Quickly. Visually.
          </div>

        <div className='qna'>
          <div>Q 6. Can I download Poke on iOS?</div>
          <div className='ans'>
            Not just yet ‚Äî Poke isn't on the Apple App Store right now. We're
            working hard to bring it to iOS soon. Hang tight ‚Äî it's coming your
            way üòä
